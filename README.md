🛡️ Malware Detection System

This project implements a Machine Learning-Based Malware Detection System using Random Forest Classifier.  
It extracts Portable Executable (PE) file features and predicts whether a given file is malicious or benign.  
The system includes both a training pipeline and a Flask-based web application for live detection.
